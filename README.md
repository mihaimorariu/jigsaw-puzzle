# Jigsaw Puzzle #

This repository contains my implementation for the jigsaw puzzle. Given an image as input, an NxN puzzle is generated from it, with N between 3 and 6, inclusively. The user can shuffle the pieces at any time, by clicking on "Shuffle" or can check the correct solution by clicking on "Solve".

Have fun playing!
